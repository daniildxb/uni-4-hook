# Claude Guidelines for uni-4-hook Project

1. This is a real project. Don't add hacks or workarounds "for the sake of finishing a task". 

2. Don't waste computational resources by making unnecessary changes to the contract initialization flow.

3. Make minimal changes to achieve the requirements. If a task can be completed with a simple solution, use it.

4. If you can't complete a task properly, stop and communicate the issue clearly instead of implementing a problematic solution.

5. Focus on the specific request and don't make changes to unrelated parts of the codebase.

6. Don't add unnecessary abstractions or over-engineer solutions.

7. Maintain the architectural integrity of the project.

8. Never stage or commit changes yourself, always leave it up to me to decide when to commit.
